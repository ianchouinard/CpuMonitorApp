# ComputerMonitor

To run the angular app locally run "ng serve" after "npm install" from this directory.

Ng serve will currently serve the front end using a fake data generator. But it can also be enabled to use the Java api that is also in this repo.

An example of this front end using the fake data generator can be viewed here...

** Note: the java server needs to be the api endpoint for the unit test for the dashboard.service to work.


## Main app component

The main app component in this project is essentially just a place to render the header/footer and a router-outlet

## Module routing & lazy loading: "/src/app/app-routing.module.ts"

This module handles the feature module routing. It also initializes code splitting for the modules and lazy loading (currently, this is just for the dashboard module)

## interceptors "/intercepters/*.ts"

Currently contains a generic interceptor to alert the user if any request fails. This could be expanded on to display different errors based on the error response, or re-route the user. If this project was using any sort of authentication, we could also use an interceptor to pass an auth token or something with each request.

## pipes module "/src/app/modules/pipes/"

This module declares and exports common pipes. This module gets imported to modules that need it (ex dashboard.module). Currently the only pipe in here is a transform to convert byte value to GB

## Dashboard module "/src/app/modules/dashboard/"

Rundown of this example module

    - /Components
        - This directory contains the smaller components that are used through the module
    - /models
        - Models used through the module. In this case I'm just using the single model here for type checking, so I chose to use an interface as I didn't need this being compiled to the source javascript code.
    - /services
        - Service used in module
    - /dashboard
        - I refer to this as a parent component. I call a parent component a component that is used as a child route in the module (see dashboard.module). Other than being used as a routed component, I'll use the parent component as a place to call the smaller components from /components, and to request data from a service, and allow it to propogate through it's child component's input properties. Because this type of component is more like a page rather than a component, I do not place it in the /components directory.
